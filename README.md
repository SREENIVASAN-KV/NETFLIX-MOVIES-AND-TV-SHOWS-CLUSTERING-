# NETFLIX-MOVIES-AND-TV-SHOWS-CLUSTERING-
## Problem Statement ##
This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine.

In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.
## Approach ##
1) Performed detailed EDA inorder to untangle hidden intuitions from the data.
2) Merged the text columns together and performed text preprocessing using Snowball stemmer, TF-IDF vectorizer etc.
3) Performed PCA to reduce the dimensionality.
4) Implemented K-Means clustering and derived meaningful clusters of netflix contents.
5) Plotted an interactive plot to explain and to visualize the clusters clearly.
6) Implemented a netflix recommendation system based on our K-Means clustering


## Result ##


Processed the text data with the help of NLP techniques and used it together with the categorical variables and performed clustering. Implemented a content based recommendation using K-Means clustering.


## Challenges ##

1)Tackling the text data and making it useful in the final modelling.
## Future scopes ##

1)More extended eda
2)Implementing collaborative filtering based recommendation systems by gathering user data.
